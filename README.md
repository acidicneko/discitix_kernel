## About
The word, 'Discitix', has been derived from the latin word, 'Discite', which means "to learn".
This kernel is beign developed by me for fun and to learn about low-level world of computers.
Discitix aims to provide nostalagic feel of old console or TTYs like OS, eg. MS-DOS, and not go into modern world of GUI.
The "ix" in the last is added to follow the Unix naming style.

The Owl has been choosen the mascot for Discitix by me as it represents knowledge and wisdom.
And this kernel is being developed to gain only knowledge! Isn't it?
This is a testing and learning kernel and not a daily driver and in future too, it won't be!
